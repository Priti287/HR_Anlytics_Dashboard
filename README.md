# HR_Anlytics_Dashboard
This project showcases an HR Analytics Dashboard created in Power BI to analyze employee attrition based on various factors, including department, salary, age, distance from work, tenure, and job satisfaction. The dashboard provides actionable insights to help HR teams understand attrition patterns and take proactive measures to improve employee retention.

# Objective

The primary goal of this dashboard is to assist HR professionals and business leaders in:
Identifying key drivers of employee attrition.
Understanding how demographic and job-related factors influence turnover rates.
Formulating data-driven strategies to improve job satisfaction and retention.

# Key Features

Attrition Analysis: Interactive charts showing attrition rates by department, age, salary, and other metrics.
Correlations and Patterns: Insights into how factors like job satisfaction and commuting distance impact attrition.
Department-Wise Breakdown: Comparative analysis of attrition across different departments.
Employee Demographics: Exploration of age, tenure, and salary distributions among employees.

# Insights from the Dashboard

Attrition by Department: Departments with higher attrition rates were identified, helping prioritize intervention strategies.
Salary vs. Attrition: Lower salary brackets were linked to higher attrition rates, especially in specific departments.
Job Satisfaction Impact: Employees with lower job satisfaction were more likely to leave, irrespective of tenure or salary.
Distance from Work: Long commute times correlated with increased attrition rates.
Tenure and Attrition: Early-tenure employees (less than 2 years) exhibited higher turnover compared to mid- and late-tenure employees.

# Technologies Used
Power BI: For interactive visualization and analysis.
Data Source: Simulated data representing employee records and attrition details.
Data Transformation: Performed using Power Query within Power BI.
